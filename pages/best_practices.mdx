# Best Practices

To make your experience with Controller as smooth as possible, we recommend the following tips

### Use keywords to communicate your intent clearly

The following keywords: `Create`, `Get`, `Update`, `Delete` signal clearly to Controller the type of action you want to perform. Prioritize these keywords over other synonyms.

```
# Optimal instruction
Update Linear issue number 25 to be titled "Talk to Users"
```
```
# Less optimal instruction
Mark Linear issue number 25's title as "Talk to Users"
```

### Use the exact name of the integration in your instruction where possible

```
