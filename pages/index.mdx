## What is Controller?

Controller is an AI connected to your applications. It serves as a Unified Platform across your tools such as Slack, Linear, Google Suite, etc. Itâ€™s like ChatGPT that can interact with all your applications!

Controller is also Open Source!

## Features

- Talk to a single application (e.g. "Get me all linear tickets that are owned by Mike, and set me as the owner")

msg him on Slack and Discord about the feedback from users")
