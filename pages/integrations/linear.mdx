# OAuth 2.0 Authentication
How to quickly get a Linear OAuth application set up.

It is recommended you create a workspace for the purpose of managing the OAuth2 Application, as each admin user will have access.

## Create an OAuth2 application in Linear
Create a new <Link href="https://linear.app/settings/api/applications/new" style={{ color: '#3b82f6', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>OAuth2 Application</Link>

## Configure the redirect callback and redirect URLs

1. Add any Application name, Developer name.

2. Add ```https://controller-frontend.vercel.app/``` as the Developer URL

3. Add ```https://controller-frontend.vercel.app/api/oauth2/callback``` as the Callback URL

4. Click the big blue Create button

It should look something like this
<Image src="/linear.png" alt="Linear OAuth setup" width={800} height={400} />

Hit Login with Linear. Done!
